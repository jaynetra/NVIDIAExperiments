# What is this notebook about?
Gen AI powered question answer application in a notebook to learn about Medicare Part D medication spend 

# Motivation
In healthcare, adoption of LLM powered applications is slow in comparision to other industries. 
Pragmatic and cautionous approach in Gen AI adoption is more common in health care, in contrast to 'AI first approach' in other industries like media. Maturity of tools that build trust e.g. explainable AI, guardrails etc. is the key for increased adoption. 

This notebook explores the use of NEMO guardrail tool for a RAG application answering questions on medications spend with a publicly available data.
