    "# What is this notebook about?\n",
    "Gen AI powered question answer application in a notebook to learn about Medicare Part D medication spend \n",
    "\n",
    "# Motivation\n",
    "In healthcare, adoption of LLM powered applications is slow in comparision to other industries. \n",
    "Pragmatic and cautionous approach in Gen AI adoption is more common in health care, in contrast to 'AI first approach' in other industries like media. Maturity of tools that build trust e.g. explainable AI, guardrails etc. is the key for increased adoption. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the use of NEMO guardrail tool for a RAG application answering questions on medications spend with a publicly available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Goals\n",
    "Use healthcare related public data from CMS \n",
    "\n",
    "Guardrail the LLM response to the subject\n",
    "\n",
    "Use NVIDIA and Open Source Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tools\n",
    "LLM : Open source mixtral AI LLM - mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1\n",

    "\n",
    "# What is demonstrated\n",
    "When the question is related to medication spend, the answer is related with and without guardrails.\n",
    "When you ask the llm to tell a joke, without guardrail it tells a joke, but politely refuse with guardrails.\n",
